# Part 4 - Cleanup

Now that we're done with the lab, we need to clean up all of the resources that we used so that we don't get billed for them.

1. Navigate to the RDS console, and delete the RDS database.  This will take 5-10 minutes.

1. Navigate to the EC2 console, and terminate the EC2 instance.  This will take 5-10 minutes.

1. Navigate to the VPC management page, and delete the following resources:
    - security groups
    - subnets
    - the VPC

1. Sign out of your IAM user account, and sign back in as root.  Navigate to the IAM console, and delete the IAM user you created for this lab.
